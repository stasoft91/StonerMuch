# Stoner Much

## About
[Ready to use application](https://stonermuch.com/)

It's a simple app to track your smoking habits. It's a PWA, so you can install it on your phone and use it offline. It's also a Vue 3 app, so it's fast and responsive.
Data is stored in your browser's IndexedDB ([Dexie](https://dexie.org/)), therefore it's not synced between devices automatically, but you can import and export in a readable json file.
